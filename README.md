dusort
------
Run du with an admin user and sort the output. Everything is done within screen, so won't halt on network disconnection

Usage: dusort ADMIN PATH

ADMIN - admin user that can read all users' files

PATH - path to tree that should be interrogated

Note: if wants to sort by level, might be easier to use tree --du, but difficult to know if it works, because it prints out the tree only when finished!
